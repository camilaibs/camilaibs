I'm a Software Engineer, Teacher and Speaker that really love to work with JavaScript and popular libraries/frameworks such as React, Marko JS and AngularJS.
Before it I worked as Backend developer, it was fundamental for me to understand how it works dealing with Monolithic applications, Microservices, Relational e Document based data bases, Async Processing and etc.
I worked as well as a System Analyst, in this position I elaborated technical specifications to be used by Developers and validated their work.
Additionally, I worked in IT Governance as a Process Analyst, which developed my ability to map business processes & identify deficiencies in order to build and apply solutions.
